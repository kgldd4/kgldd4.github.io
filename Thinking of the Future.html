<h1>Thinking of the future</h1>
<p>The more I think about it, the more I am not sure what I want to do in the future. Of course I am getting my degree in environmental science, but I am getting less and less sure on what the next steps should be. Do I continue on my path and go to Law School, or Grad School, or do I find an adult job after getting this degree?</p>
<h3>Some factors in my Decision are...</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Location</li>
    <li>Money</li>
    <li>Friends and Family</li>
    <li>Job Market/Availability</li>
</ul>
<p>I would love to eventually move somewhere outside of Missouri, and I think the pacific northwest would be perfect for me</p>
